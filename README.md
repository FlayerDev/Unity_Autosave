# Unity_Autosave
Autosave for Unity Editor

THIS IS NOT MY CODE!
I originally found this in a forum a month ago and im looking for the person who answered with this to credit him.

Go to line 35 and enter the preferred minutes in the method parameters (nextSaveTime = nextSaveTime.AddMinutes(minutes between autosaves);)

My file location in the project is currently Assets/Plugins/Autosave/Editor/
